	Preview of Arma Graphical User Interface (GUI) grids

	Copy to config.cpp or description.ext.
	'RscText' base class has to be defined.

	* For more information see https://community.bistudio.com/wiki/GUI_Coordinates
	* To see interactive preview, follow these steps:
		1. Open Eden Editor
		2. Open debug console (Tools > Debug Console)
		3. Execute this code: 0 = (findDisplay 313) createDisplay "RscTestGrids";
